Today was my first day in the UK. My 9:00pm flight from Newark landed in Heathrow at 9:00am thanks to the 5hr time jump. Once we arrived we all met up with our advisor, professor MacCormick (who prefers to be called JMac), and took the "tube" to our hotel in central London (The Ridgemont Hotel).

# Observations
* Inexplicably, English people seem to like to run (exercise) while wearing backpacks??
* Our lunch waiter was very surprised when we tried to tip him by writing an amount on the receipt to charge the card extra. Apparently that's not a thing here?
