Today was my first day in the UK. My 9:00pm flight from Newark landed in Heathrow at 9:00am thanks to the 5hr time jump. Once we arrived we all met up with our advisor, professor MacCormick (who prefers to be called JMac), and took the "tube" to our hotel in central London (The Ridgemont Hotel). I got lunch (pizza) with my roommate Sam. In the evening we had a group trip to the British Library where we visited the Ritblat gallery.

# Observations
* Inexplicably, English people seem to like to go on runs while wearing backpacks??
* Our lunch waiter was very surprised when we payed with a credit card and tried to tip him by writing the tip amount on the receipt. Apparently tips are only made in cash here.
* They drive on the wrong side of the road!
* I was nearly hit by a bus.
* I was nearly hit by a biker.
* The drinking age here is 18 and since I'll turn 21 while I'm here I will never again not be legal.
