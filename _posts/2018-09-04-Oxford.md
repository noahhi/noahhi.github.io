Turns out my goal of writing a post every 2-3 days might have been a little too ambitious. JMac has been keeping us so busy with events throughout the day that I barely have energy left to do my readings and HW at night, let alone anything else. That said Sunday was our first free day. I didn't set an alarm figuring I would sleep in but my body had other plans and after waking up at 7:00am I went for a nice long run along the Thames. Then I went searching for the famed giant shirtless statue of Jeff Goldblum (put up to commemorate the 25 year anniversary of Jurassic park). Tragically it has been taken down, but in my quest for Jeff I stumbled upon the Chinese Food Festival which was fun, and an outdoor amphitheater called The Scoop, where I was fortunate enough to see a (free) performance of the Wizard of Oz. I also took a tour of the warship the HMS Belfast which sits in the Thames nearby the Tower Bridge.

On Monday we went to the Royal Society, ('the world's oldest independent scientific academy'), where we got a guided tour. Highlights included Newton's *Principia* and Hooke's *Micrographia*. Sam and I had ramen for lunch and then a few minutes to walk around Trafalgar square and through The National Gallery (we did the standard 5 minute art museum speed run). Next we had a classroom session and a quiz. In the evening I attended an optional Prom concert in the Albert Royal hall, which consisted of 20th-century classical music by Bernstein and Shostakovich, performed by the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

# Observations
* Taking the bus is way more fun than the tube, worth the extra time.
* I will however have nightmares of being a London bus driver. The things are huge and the spaces they have to fit them are tiny. There are pedestrians and bikers everywhere and they frequently cut in front of busses forcing abrupt braking.
* Their traffic lights go green-yellow-red-YELLOW-green. I suppose it's slightly more efficient since drivers known when to start getting ready.
