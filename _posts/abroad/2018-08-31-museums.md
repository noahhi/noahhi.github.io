It's Friday evening meaning I've now made it through 3 full days here in London. (still waiting for my English accent to show up). On Thursday we went to the London science museum which reminded me of the Franklin Institute only bigger. Afterwards we walked around the HUGE Hyde park where we saw The Albert Memorial, Kensington Palace, and a flying trapeze school (also people playing cricket, a whole lot of ducks, and more backpack runners)!

Today we went to the Wellcome library where we got to see a bunch of Newton, Galileo and Edward Jenner's (pioneer of the smallpox vaccine) original manuscripts and journals. Then Sam and I went on an optional walking tour/historical scavenger hunt through Soho, Leicester Square and the Spitalfields market. As a reward Jmac bought us drinks at the Marlborough Arms pub where he attempted to explain cricket to us and we discussed the greatness of Monty Python! Got "Wok to Walk" for dinner and tried "Greengages" which are some weird grape looking things.

# Observations
* The "American" section in the supermarket consisted of marshmellows, twinkies, lucky charms, and candy.
* The English snack food selections are WEAK. (perhaps this is correlated to their relatively low rates of obesityðŸ¤”)
* Their "Bacon" is not bacon. It's not terrible but don't get your hopes up.
* Saw a pair of jeans almost identical to mine that were Â£225. Stuff here ain't cheap.
