I took a Networks class during the spring semester of the junior year at Dickinson. For our final project, we were tasked with creating either a client-server or p2p architecture which was able to handle multiple clients simultaneously. My partner, <a href="https://quanchau.github.io/">Quan Chau</a>, and I decided to create a Connect4 server. While the server is running, any number of clients (on the same LAN) can connect to it remotely and the server will handle pairing up players in games against each other. We also implemented an AI using the mini-max algorithm so that a single player can play games against the server. When playing against the AI, Players can select a difficulty ranging from easy to practically impossible (although with perfect play, whoever goes first should win every time). Checkout our <a href="https://github.com/noahhi/Connect4">github repo</a> for the code and instructions on running the server yourself, and see below for a sample session playing the bot.
