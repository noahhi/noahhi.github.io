I created an android app to serve as a companion app for the board game Settlers of Catan. Each turn of the game revolves heavily around the roll of 2 6-sided die which determines who gets to pick up resources and who doesn't. This means there is a large element of luck in the game, and a player can easily win or lose depending on whether the roll distribution favors them or their opponents over the course of a game. The goal of this app is to allow players to easily record the rolls throughout the game and nicely display the distribution.

This can be informative and fun to look at, especially for a player who has been particularly unlucky and wants to justify their poor performance. The app also can provide a quantitative measure of each player's 'luck' throughout the game. This is accomplished by entering each player's settlements so that the app can record expected resource gain (based on the expected roll distribution) as well as actual resource gain (based on the actual roll distribution). The 'luck' for each player can then be calculated by comparing these two values.

You will soon be able to download my app from the Google Play store. Note that it is currently in beta and you are likely to encounter (many) bugs. This is my first android app so don't be too hard on me!
