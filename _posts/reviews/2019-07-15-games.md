## Chess
I started playing chess with my dad and brother a long time ago. Over the past couple of years, I've gotten into playing bullet and blitz online. You can see my chess.com profile <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/gymnastictoast">here</a> and challenge me to a game.

**Achievements**

-I recently hit my personal rating high 1,600 in blitz

-I scored 30 in puzzle rush on chess.com

-I played against the infamous chess hustler 'Big John' in NYC (and lost. But I swear it was close!)

## Hearthstone
Hearthstone is an online collectible card game which came out in 2014. I've played off and on since then, and these days I mostly only play arena.

**Achievements**

-\#1 ranked arena player in January, 2019 (averaged 9.03 wins)

-\#30 ranked arena player in November, 2018 (averaged 7.6 wins)

-\#59 ranked standard finish in November, 2015
